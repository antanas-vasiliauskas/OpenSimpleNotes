1. Don't overcomplicate things when fixing errors
2. Do only what you told and don't add extra unrelated things
3. Don't output code to window, just change the files, I can see the changes in the IDE
4. Don't mention your inability to create files, because that is not the case.
4. Don't use terminal commands, just edit the files directly
5. When responding, consider in answer, that I'm using .NET 8 at it might have nuanced differences compared to previous versions
